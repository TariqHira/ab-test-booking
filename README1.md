# ‚úàÔ∏è A/B Testing Flight Booking Conversion Rates

> üåü A practical data science project simulating an A/B test to evaluate the effect of a new pricing strategy on flight booking conversions ‚Äî set in the context of an imaginary travel platform, **MyTravel.com**.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The **Flight Booking Team at MyTravel.com** has rolled out a new pricing strategy. To assess whether this strategy is actually increasing flight bookings ‚Äî or if the observed change is simply due to chance ‚Äî they've tasked **Miss Reem**, a **Data Scientist**, with designing and conducting a hypothesis test.

Miss Reem's job is not just to crunch numbers, but to ensure the experiment is statistically as well as practically significant, the data is analyzed rigorously, and the results are interpreted in a way that guides strategic decisions.

This project takes you through a realistic workflow:

- Simulate user-level booking data
- Design and implement an A/B test
- Apply hypothesis testing
- Visualize and interpret results

All with the goal of helping data professionals build intuition and confidence in experimentation.

## üë• Target Audience

This project is designed for:

- Aspiring or working **Data Scientists**, **Analysts**, and **Product Managers**
- Candidates preparing for **A/B testing or product analytics interviews**
- Learners looking to **understand and apply hypothesis testing in a practical setting**

## üß™ Why Hypothesis Testing?

In any A/B test, the key question is:

> ‚ÄúIs the observed improvement real or just random noise?‚Äù

That‚Äôs where **hypothesis testing** comes in.

### üîç What is Hypothesis Testing?

Miss Reem knows that hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The process involves:

- **Formulating two hypotheses:**

  - **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Assumes no effect or no difference (e.g., "There is no difference in conversion rates between the control and treatment pages").
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Assumes there is an effect or a difference (e.g., "The new pricing page increases conversions").

- **Collecting data** from experiments or observations.

- **Analyzing the data** to determine whether the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.
